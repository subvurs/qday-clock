# Changelog — Q-day Clock

All notable changes, gate fires, and reversals are recorded here.
Per CLAUDE.md §1 (failure-reporting parity), reversals get the same
prominence as advances.

The format is loosely [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
with project-specific sections for `Gate fires` and `Reversals`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Path H: daily cron enabled + first end-to-end smoke (2026-06-27)
Two workflow-only PRs (no package version bump — no Python code shipped):

- **PR #1** ([qday-clock#1](https://github.com/subvurs/qday-clock/pull/1),
  branch `qday-clock/enable-daily-cron-v02`, squash-merged
  2026-06-27T00:05:12Z as commit `d1bd6b6a`): uncommented the
  `schedule: cron: "0 8 * * *"` line in `refresh.yml`. First scheduled
  fire 2026-06-27 08:00 UTC.

  Scope cut, recorded per rigor §1: the cron path still runs SEEDS-ONLY
  because the `Fetch Curator manifest` step is gated on
  `inputs.curator_manifest_url != ''`, which is empty under cron. A
  follow-on PR will default that input to
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subvurs/quantum-curator/manifest/curator_manifest.json`
  so the cron path actually consumes the upstream manifest. Two-PR
  split is intentional — each behavior change reviewable on its own,
  and the URL default waited until after the smoke proved the URL
  serves content.

- **PR #2** ([qday-clock#2](https://github.com/subvurs/qday-clock/pull/2),
  branch `qday-clock/fix-workflow-cwd`, squash-merged
  2026-06-27T00:20:22Z as commit `cc320f8`): removed the stale
  `defaults: run: working-directory: public_interest/qday_clock` block
  from `refresh.yml`. It was a leftover from when `qday_clock` lived
  as a subdirectory of the Subvurs monorepo; the standalone repo has
  `qday_clock/` at the root. Discovered by the K11 smoke (run
  `28272363714` failed at `Install Q-day Clock` with "No such file or
  directory" for that path). PR CI had never caught this because PR
  CI only runs the tests job, not the refresh job.

### End-to-end smoke (run 2026-06-27 — Curator → manifest branch → refresh.yml)
This is the first time the full **K11 → `subvurs/quantum-curator`
manifest branch → `raw.githubusercontent.com` → `refresh.yml`
workflow_dispatch → signature verify → `compute_clock_state`** path
has run live.

| Stage | Evidence |
|---|---|
| K11 `quantum-curator qday-export` | 167 articles, 240801 bytes, local `verify_payload=True`; curator commit `55efcfa5c591` |
| Force-push → manifest branch | commit `33152bb` on `subvurs/quantum-curator` (first push, branch created at that moment) |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` GET | HTTP 200, byte-identical 240801 bytes |
| `refresh.yml` workflow_dispatch | run [28272654436](https://github.com/subvurs/qday-clock/actions/runs/28272654436) — Install + Fetch + Recompute + Diff all green in 23 s |
| Signature verified vs `QDAY_CURATOR_PUBKEY_B64` | log line: `refresh: ingested manifest with 167 articles, commit=55efcfa5c591` (no `VerificationError`) |
| Clock state | `clock_score = 0.4153`, `clock_hours = 14.03` |
| Refresh PR opened? | No — recomputed `site/data/clock_state.json` is byte-identical to current `main` (deterministic; expected outcome, not a fault) |

Curator-side pubkey: `w2jrKwsAQoSBOq8wgqEVIQd0gzs56/KmMBLFuXUy+d0=`
(distinct from the Q-day Clock state-signing key
`gpg724ZUbG1PHzEI9L/dhcJGkbz5S/251STdeN3P0YU=` documented above — two
separate concerns, two separate secrets).

### What this leg confirms

1. The `qday-export` → `fetch_manifest` → `classify_manifest` pydantic
   contract holds on the wire: 167 articles round-tripped through
   canonical-JSON, Ed25519 signature, force-push, raw fetch,
   `verify_payload`, classification, scoring.
2. The pinned-pubkey defense works end-to-end: the workflow secret
   matches the K11 signing key, so an attacker swapping the manifest
   branch content (or compromising a different curator instance) would
   trip `VerificationError` at `fetch_manifest` line 1 — before any
   axis reading is touched.
3. The orphan-branch + force-push pattern (one-commit, single-file
   `curator_manifest.json` on a dedicated branch) is the right
   distribution shape: `gh-pages` deploy of the Crier remains
   unaffected, history stays at exactly one commit, and
   `raw.githubusercontent.com` serves the JSON immediately on push.

### Open follow-ups (next session)

- Default `curator_manifest_url` so the cron path consumes the
  manifest. Now that the URL is provably serving content, the
  precondition is cleared.
- Watch the first scheduled cron fire (2026-06-27 08:00 UTC) — should
  log `refresh: no manifest URL provided; seeds-only refresh` and
  diff clean (no PR), unless the cron and the smoke disagree on
  the seed-only baseline, in which case there's an axis-drift bug
  worth running down.

### Added
- `site/CNAME` set to `icqubit.com` (Mark-owned domain for the deploy
  target).
- Ed25519 signing keypair generated at
  `~/.config/qday_clock/signing_ed25519.{key,pub}` (mode 0600 on the
  private file). Public key fingerprint:
  `gpg724ZUbG1PHzEI9L/dhcJGkbz5S/251STdeN3P0YU=`. Round-trip
  sign / verify / tamper-detect smoke passed before the key was
  persisted. Private key is **not** in the repo; the public key is
  rendered into `site/about.html` via `{{ pubkey_b64 }}` at deploy
  time (template already wired).
- `data/seed_signals.json` expanded from 3 → **17** axis-1 signals
  (6 hardware / 7 theory / 4 roadmap), date range 2024-09-06 →
  2026-05-22, drawn from the Subvurs Quantum Curator corpus
  (manually classified per CLAUDE.md §3 evidence-class rules — no
  press release labelled as hardware demo).
- Cold-start reading with expanded seeds:
  `clock_score = 0.2607`, `clock_hours = 17.74`, band
  `[11.82, 23.22] h`, 0 gates fired. Axis 1 reading
  `0.463` from 15 independent sources, confidence band
  `[0.30, 0.70]`. Axes 2–5 still floored to the GRI 2024 baseline
  (`0.580`) since their extractors are deferred to v0.2.

### Added — Path B: Curator manifest pipeline wired
- **Curator side**: `quantum_curator/qday_export.py` + `qday-export`
  CLI subcommand (registered in the curator's `[project.scripts]`).
  Filters `raw_articles` to the four Q-day-relevant `ContentTopic`
  values (HARDWARE, ALGORITHMS, ERROR_CORRECTION, CRYPTOGRAPHY),
  builds a `CuratorManifest` (Q-day Clock pydantic schema imported
  directly so the signed shape can never silently drift), signs with
  Ed25519 via `qday_clock.core.signing`. Tight canonicalization
  coupling, loose data coupling — Curator owns the DB, Q-day Clock
  owns the contract. First live export: **204 articles signed,
  pubkey `gpg724ZUbG1PHzEI9L/dhcJGkbz5S/251STdeN3P0YU=`,
  db_row_counts={raw_articles: 448, curated_posts: 28, sources: 18}**.
- **Q-day Clock side**: `qday_clock/ingest/curator_client.fetch_manifest()`
  replaced the v0.2-deferred stub. Loader returns a validated
  `CuratorManifest` with the signature **already verified** (no
  caller forgets to call verify). Six distinct fail-closed
  `error_code`s — one per failure mode, per CLAUDE.md §8:
  - `ingest.manifest_not_found`
  - `ingest.manifest_bad_json`
  - `ingest.manifest_bad_shape` (covers both "not a JSON object" and
    schema-validation failures)
  - `ingest.manifest_unsigned` (default; `require_signature=False`
    is the documented debug-only escape)
  - `ingest.manifest_pubkey_mismatch` (optional pinning via
    `expected_pubkey=`)
  - `ingest.manifest_bad_signature` (covers both tampered body and
    swapped-pubkey-with-original-sig attack)
- **Classifier**: `qday_clock/extract/classifier.py`. Conservative
  manifest→`Signal` router: each article is fed to
  `axis_logical_qubits.extract`; if extraction fails (no numeric
  found, even with keyword hits), no signal is emitted — fail-closed
  per CLAUDE.md §10 (calibrated uncertainty). Evidence class is
  derived from the curator's topic tags via a fixed priority order:
  hardware → policy → cryptography → error_correction → algorithms
  → simulation → research, defaulting to `THEORY`. Signal IDs are
  deterministic (`sig_<sha256(post_id|axis)[:16]>`) so re-running
  the pipeline on the same manifest produces byte-identical signals.
- **Refresh workflow**: `.github/workflows/refresh.yml`. Currently
  `workflow_dispatch`-only — the daily cron line is intentionally
  commented out and v0.2 enables it once Curator publishes a signed
  artifact reliably. Optional `curator_manifest_url` input lets a
  human trigger a seeded refresh against a specific manifest URL.
  Uses the `QDAY_CURATOR_PUBKEY_B64` repo secret for pubkey pinning
  in CI. Opens a PR via `peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6` if
  `site/data/` changed — **never auto-publishes** per plan §F.

### Path B smoke (run 2026-06-04)
- End-to-end: 204-article manifest → classifier → clock pipeline
  produced 4 axis-1 signals (3 hardware, 1 theory).
- Combined reading with 17 seeds + 4 manifest signals:
  `clock_score = 0.2760`, `clock_hours = 17.38`, band
  `[11.82, 23.22] h`, **0 gates fired**. Axis-1 reading
  `0.5238` from 16 independent sources (up from 15 / 0.463 at the
  seeds-only baseline); axes 2–5 still at GRI 2024 floor.
- The +0.06 axis-1 movement is sub-gate-threshold (the
  `MultiSourceConfirmationGate` lands in v0.2 with a 0.15 step
  trigger). Movement is therefore noted but not flagged.

### Tests — Path B
- `tests/ingest/test_curator_client.py` — **11 tests** (3 happy,
  8 negative; one test per distinct `error_code` per CLAUDE.md §8).
  Includes both `tampered_body_fails_verification` and
  `swapped_key_fails_verification` so a refactor can't accept a
  sig under the wrong pubkey.
- `tests/extract/test_classifier.py` — **16 tests** covering
  single-article routing (positive + two fail-conservative
  negatives), all 7 evidence-class priority slots, `signal_id`
  determinism + cross-axis separation, manifest-level routing,
  and a full manifest → classifier → `ClockState` end-to-end.

### Verification — Unreleased (post Path B)
- `pytest tests/ -q` → **92 passed** (was 65; +11 ingest, +16
  classifier).
- `python -m qday_clock.verify.replay --replay tests/golden/manifest_2026_q1.json`
  → `aa5a8c11dd0981ce19a191aa74eadeb7ec51211f7efe7793aff0b5bbee242fe9`
  (byte-identical to v0.1.0 lock — Path B introduced no scoring
  changes).
- The golden fixture uses its own inline signals, so neither the
  seed expansion nor the manifest pipeline perturbs the locked
  replay hash; the larger seed set + classifier path are exercised
  by `tests/test_smoke.py` and the new ingest/extract suites.

### Path B — what's still deferred (still v0.2)
- Curator-side workflow that publishes the signed manifest as a
  release artifact (until that lands, `refresh.yml` is the
  human-triggered fallback).
- Daily cron in `refresh.yml` (uncomment once artifact is reliable).

### Added — Path C: axes 2–5 + remaining 5 gates
- **Axis 2 — physical qubit scaling**: `extract/axis_physical_scaling.py`.
  Log-scale anchor `100 → 10k → 1M → 20M` physical qubits; vendor name
  list (IBM Condor/Flamingo/Kookaburra, Google Sycamore/Willow, IonQ
  Tempo, Quantinuum H/Helios, Atom Computing, PsiQuantum) treated as
  keyword hits even without explicit "qubit" tokens; comma-thousands
  numerics parsed.
- **Axis 3 — resource estimate (Shor + AES/Grover)**: `extract/axis_resource_estimate.py`.
  Gidney-Ekera anchor (20M qubits / 8 h = 0.0); peer-reviewed ≤1M
  qubits or ≤1 h = 0.5; ≤100k qubits or ≤1 min = 1.0. AES-128/Grover
  is a sub-channel folded in at `AES_SUB_WEIGHT = 0.3` so AES alone
  cannot drive the axis past `0.3` ("weakens, not breaks" framing
  from `THREAT_MODEL.md`).
- **Axis 4 — error rate floor**: `extract/axis_error_rate.py`. Anchor
  `1e-2 → 0` (NISQ floor) and `1e-5 → 1.0` (well below the surface
  code threshold), log-linearly interpolated. Tie-break on identical
  numerics is fp-tolerant via `round(pair[0], 9)`; `_ERROR_MAX = 0.05`
  prevents non-error-rate percents (e.g. "5% improvement") from
  registering.
- **Axis 5 — PQC migration (inverse)**: `extract/axis_pqc_migration.py`.
  Severity tiers — mandate (1.0), broad deployment (0.7), pilot (0.5),
  standardization (0.3), bare mention (0.1). Unlike axes 1–4, axis 5
  returns a non-`None` reading on every keyword-gate match (bare
  mentions floor at 0.1 rather than failing out). Combined into the
  clock via subtraction (axis 5 ↑ ⇒ clock score ↓).
- **Classifier wiring**: `extract/classifier.py` now routes every
  article through all five axes (`_PER_ARTICLE_ROUTERS` tuple). A
  single article may produce signals on multiple axes — a hardware
  release citing both a qubit count and a gate error is a normal
  multi-axis case.
- **`MultiSourceConfirmationGate`** (`score/gates.py`): proposed
  axis-step > `min_step` (0.15) requires ≥ `min_sources` (2) distinct
  `source` strings within a `window_days` (30 d) rolling window,
  otherwise the gate fires with `multiplier = 0.5`. Step comparison
  uses `+ 1e-9` tolerance so `0.45 − 0.30 = 0.15…02` lands on the
  "no confirmation required" side at the threshold (boundary test
  pinned in `tests/adversarial/test_multi_source_confirmation_gate.py`).
- **`RoadmapWeightCapGate`** (`score/gates.py`): caps signals with
  `evidence_class == ROADMAP` to a normalized contribution of at most
  `cap` (0.3). Hardware / theory / simulation / policy / survey
  signals pass through unchanged — preserves the CLAUDE.md §3
  evidence-class asymmetry.
- **`StaleSignalGate`** (`score/gates.py`): full weight up to
  `fresh_days` (18·30 ≈ 18 months), linear decay to zero across the
  window `[fresh_days, stale_days]` (36·30 ≈ 36 months), zero
  contribution beyond. Evidence-class agnostic — pure freshness policy
  (the asymmetry is RoadmapWeightCapGate's job).
- **`AntiStiffnessGate`** (`score/gates.py`): any single-refresh axis
  step > `max_step` (0.4) triggers `multiplier = 0.5`. Fires on
  magnitude alone, independent of source count — distinguishes it
  from MultiSourceConfirmationGate. Both gates can fire on the same
  step. Symmetric: positive and negative jumps treated equally (§1
  parity).
- **`ContrastSaturationGate`** (`score/gates.py`): caps any single
  signal's share of an axis to `cap` (0.5). Distinct from
  SingleSourceCapGate (which caps per source name): this caps
  per-signal so one outlier observation from a unique source cannot
  dominate.
- **`GateBundle`**: now wires `multi_source`, `roadmap_cap`,
  `stale_signal`, `anti_stiffness`, `contrast_saturation` alongside
  the v0.1 set. `all_verdicts(...)` gained optional
  `axis_step_proposals` (per-axis step-changes for the two step gates)
  and `per_signal_share` (per-signal share for ContrastSaturation),
  and runs StaleSignalGate per signal when a `now=` clock-time is
  supplied. Backwards-compatible: callers using only v0.1 gates
  produce identical verdict lists.
- **Adversarial fixtures**: 5 new test files under
  `tests/adversarial/`, one per gate — 7 / 5 / 9 / 6 / 7 tests
  respectively (`MultiSourceConfirmation` / `RoadmapWeightCap` /
  `StaleSignal` / `AntiStiffness` / `ContrastSaturation`). All include
  boundary cases and §1 parity (negative-step + reversal) checks
  where applicable.

### Path C — gate-design notes
- The two step gates (`MultiSourceConfirmation`, `AntiStiffness`) are
  semantically complementary, not redundant. MultiSourceConfirmation
  fires on source-count, AntiStiffness fires on magnitude. A jump of
  0.55 from two independent sources still trips AntiStiffness; a jump
  of 0.20 from one source still trips MultiSourceConfirmation. The
  current production stack runs both.
- `ContrastSaturationGate` and `SingleSourceCapGate` similarly split
  responsibility: source-cap protects against one vendor producing
  many signals; contrast-saturation protects against one signal of
  extreme magnitude (potentially from a different source than the
  others). Either can fire without the other.
- The AntiStiffness / ContrastSaturation gates are *Q-day-shaped*
  analogs of the gh_eval gates of the same name. The gh_eval versions
  consume `MetricInputs` (`std_d`, `extras["saturation_rate"]`) shaped
  for OpenEvolve trajectories. Q-day has no trajectory, so I re-shaped
  the inputs onto Q-day's natural data model (axis-reading step;
  per-signal axis share) while preserving the semantic intent. This
  matches the pattern in `gh_eval/adapters/{nyx,impax}.py` where
  adapters re-skin the abstract gate I/O for their domain.

### Verification — Path C
- `pytest tests/ -q` → **201 passed** (was 92 after Path B; +22
  adversarial across the 5 new gates, +classifier and extractor
  coverage for axes 2–5).
- `pytest tests/golden/ -v` → **2 passed** (golden replay
  byte-for-byte + clock-hours range).
- Golden canonical hash unchanged:
  `aa5a8c11dd0981ce19a191aa74eadeb7ec51211f7efe7793aff0b5bbee242fe9`.
  The golden fixture uses inline signals on axis 1 only, so it is
  insensitive to axes-2–5 wiring and to gates that have not yet fired
  on a real signal. This is the intended behavior: a hash drift here
  would indicate a v0.1 scoring regression, not v0.2 scope expansion.

### Added — Path C: gate integration (production scoring path)
- **Gate wiring**: `score/clock.compute_clock_state` now instantiates
  the full v0.2 gate suite (`StaleSignalGate`, `RoadmapWeightCapGate`,
  `ContrastSaturationGate`, `MultiSourceConfirmationGate`,
  `AntiStiffnessGate`) alongside the v0.1 `SingleSourceCapGate`. Before
  this entry, the v0.2 gates were unit-tested at the gate boundary but
  never reachable from the production scoring path — Goodhart
  resistance was theoretical only. Unit-test ∧ integration-test now
  jointly demonstrate each gate is both correct in isolation and
  wired into the live pipeline.
- **`compute_clock_state` signature**: gained two kwargs.
  - `now: datetime | None = None` — reference clock-time for
    time-dependent gates (`StaleSignalGate`,
    `MultiSourceConfirmationGate`). When `None`, the stale gate is
    skipped entirely (forever-deterministic replay path);
    multi-source uses `utcnow()` only if step-change observers run at
    all.
  - `previous_axes_readings: dict[str, float] | None = None` — when
    supplied, step-change gates (`MultiSourceConfirmationGate`,
    `AntiStiffnessGate`) run as observers and record verdicts without
    retroactively editing axis values. Matches the gh_eval pattern of
    record-not-mutate for review-class gates.
- **`aggregate_axis` pipeline**: extended from a single source-cap
  step into a 5-stage pipeline, each stage preserving the symmetric
  numerator/denominator invariant (a `multiplier == 1.0` step is a
  true no-op):
  1. per-signal pre-multipliers (`stale_gate × roadmap_cap_gate`);
     stale-gate skipped when `now is None`
  2. per-source share computed against the pre-multipliers
  3. per-source `SingleSourceCapGate` (v0.1 behavior, unchanged)
  4. per-signal share fed to `ContrastSaturationGate`
  5. final aggregation stacks all three multiplier categories
     symmetrically
- **Forever-determinism**: `tests/golden/test_golden_replay.py` and
  `qday_clock/verify/replay.py` both now pin `now=observed_at` from
  the fixture. Without this, `StaleSignalGate` would silently begin
  decaying signals roughly 18 months after the fixture's observed_at
  date (~2027-09-29 for `manifest_2026_q1.json`) and drift the
  canonical hash. Per CLAUDE.md §7, the test stays
  forever-deterministic by construction, not by luck.
- **Symmetric multiplier semantic preserved**: the existing
  `SingleSourceCap` convention — multipliers apply to both numerator
  AND denominator — is held for every v0.2 gate. For an axis composed
  of a single signal, the gate's multiplier cancels out exactly: the
  *reading* is unchanged but the verdict is recorded in `gates_fired`.
  This is the explicit contract; an integration test pins it.

### Tests — Path C (gate integration)
- `tests/score/test_clock_gate_integration.py` — **9 tests** locking
  the wiring contract:
  - `test_roadmap_cap_gate_fires_through_pipeline` — roadmap
    `normalized=0.9` triggers the cap with a corroborating non-roadmap
    signal so source-cap doesn't also confuse the assertion
  - `test_roadmap_cap_gate_dampens_axis_reading` — single-signal axis
    proves the symmetric numerator/denominator contract (reading
    unchanged, verdict recorded)
  - `test_stale_signal_gate_fires_through_pipeline` — 2-year-old
    signal flagged when `now` is supplied
  - `test_stale_signal_gate_skipped_when_now_is_none` — the
    forever-deterministic replay path: no `now` means no stale gate
  - `test_contrast_saturation_fires_when_one_signal_dominates` —
    one signal at full `normalized=1.0` with near-silent companions
    trips the per-signal share cap
  - `test_anti_stiffness_fires_on_large_step` — 0.10 → 0.85 (Δ=0.75 >
    0.4) trips the magnitude gate
  - `test_multi_source_confirmation_fires_on_unconfirmed_step` —
    single-source step > 0.15 with < 2 sources trips multi-source
  - `test_step_change_gates_silent_without_previous_readings` —
    neither step gate runs without `previous_axes_readings`
  - `test_apply_gates_false_silences_all_v02_gates` — the only
    legitimate way to obtain a strictly-pre-gate reading is
    `apply_gates=False`; verifies `gates_fired == []` even when every
    gate's triggering pathology is present

### Verification — Path C (gate integration)
- `pytest tests/ -q` → **210 passed** (was 201; +9 integration tests).
- `python -m qday_clock.verify.replay --replay tests/golden/manifest_2026_q1.json`
  → `aa5a8c11dd0981ce19a191aa74eadeb7ec51211f7efe7793aff0b5bbee242fe9`
  (byte-identical to the v0.1.0 lock). The golden fixture has five
  hardware signals at the same `observed_at` with distinct sources,
  max per-signal share ≈ 0.21, and no previous reading; with
  `now=observed_at` no v0.2 gate fires, `gates_fired == []`, and the
  canonical body is preserved. Hash preservation is structural, not
  coincidental — re-derivable from the fixture parameters.

### Added — Path C: v0.2 gate-fire golden fixture
- `tests/golden/manifest_2026_v02.json` — second locked golden input
  fixture. Covers all 5 axes (10 signals total) at
  `observed_at = 2026-06-01` and is built to deterministically trigger
  the v0.2 gates that the v0.1 fixture by design does **not** fire:
  - **RoadmapWeightCapGate**: one roadmap-evidence signal on axis 1
    (`vendor-C-blog`, normalized 0.9) above the 0.3 cap → cap
    multiplier 0.3333 applied; verdict in `gates_fired`.
  - **StaleSignalGate**: one hardware signal on axis 1
    (`vendor-D-paper`, archival d=3 demo) with explicit per-signal
    `observed_at = 2024-06-01` ≈ 730 days before fixture `now`, inside
    the [`fresh_days=540`, `stale_days=1080`] decay window → linear
    decay multiplier ≈ 0.351; verdict in `gates_fired`.
  - **ContrastSaturationGate** (incidental): fires 4× on single-signal
    axes 4 and 5 and on two logical-qubits signals where the per-axis
    share crosses 0.5. Recorded but not the headline contract.
- Loader change — both `qday_clock/verify/replay.py` and
  `tests/golden/test_golden_replay.py` now honor an optional per-signal
  `observed_at` field; signals without it continue to inherit the
  fixture-wide `observed_at` exactly as before. The v0.1 manifest does
  not use the field, so the v0.1 golden hash
  `aa5a8c11dd0981ce19a191aa74eadeb7ec51211f7efe7793aff0b5bbee242fe9`
  is byte-preserved. The override exists so the stale signal can be
  aged without shifting `now`, keeping `compute_clock_state` invocations
  in golden tests forever-deterministic.
- `tests/golden/test_golden_replay_v02.py` — three pinned tests:
  - `test_golden_replay_v02_byte_for_byte` locks the canonical hash
    `9d20017e0e938d4b4a98e6d47ba545f2c73ea5c074d9973288408c2c602d0d7d`
    (RFC 8785 canonical body of the unsigned `ClockState` produced by
    replaying `manifest_2026_v02.json` with `now = observed_at` and
    `generated_at` pinned).
  - `test_golden_replay_v02_required_gates_fire` locks the Goodhart
    contract (CLAUDE.md §9): `RoadmapWeightCapGate` ≥ 1 fire and
    `StaleSignalGate` ≥ 1 fire on this fixture. A future refactor that
    silently disconnects either gate from `compute_clock_state` will
    trip this assertion even if the hash happens to coincide.
  - `test_golden_replay_v02_clock_hours_in_range` — sanity:
    `0 ≤ clock_hours ≤ 24`, `0 ≤ clock_score ≤ 1`, and no axis is
    cold-start (closes a hole the v0.1 fixture cannot cover since it
    only populates axis 1).
- Replay sanity (Path C v0.2 fixture):
  `clock_hours = 20.70`, `clock_score = 0.1375`, 6 gate verdicts in
  `gates_fired` (1 RoadmapWeightCapGate + 1 StaleSignalGate +
  4 ContrastSaturationGate). The relatively low clock_score is
  consistent with the fixture's mostly-modest normalized values across
  axes 2–5 and the stale-gate decay multiplier dragging the only
  high-value axis-1 signal down by ≈ 65%.

### Verification — Path C (v0.2 golden fixture)
- `pytest tests/ -q` → **213 passed** (was 210; +3 for the new v0.2
  golden test). v0.1 golden hash unchanged at
  `aa5a8c11dd0981ce19a191aa74eadeb7ec51211f7efe7793aff0b5bbee242fe9`.
- `python -m qday_clock.verify.replay --replay tests/golden/manifest_2026_v02.json`
  → `9d20017e0e938d4b4a98e6d47ba545f2c73ea5c074d9973288408c2c602d0d7d`
  (byte-stable across runs).
- Both golden hashes are now pinned independently — v0.1 anchors the
  pre-gate path (no triggering pathology, no verdict), v0.2 anchors
  the gate-reachable path (designed pathologies, verdicts recorded).

### Added — Path C: v0.2 UI layer (`dashboard.html` + `sources.html`)
- `site/dashboard.tmpl.html` — 5-axis dashboard with:
  - per-axis reading + weight + confidence band + signal counts table,
  - one `<details>` drill-down per axis listing
    `contributing_signal_ids` and linking to the per-signal anchor on
    `sources.html`,
  - gates-fired table sourced from `state.gates_fired` (the same gate
    records that the golden v0.2 fixture locks),
  - Mosca's-inequality informational panel (no probability or
    calendar-date framing — informational, anchored to the GRI
    baseline as the only stated `z` reference),
  - meta block: clock score, confidence band, GRI baseline,
    generated-at timestamp, schema version.
- `site/sources.tmpl.html` — per-signal provenance page with:
  - rendered table keyed by `signal_id` (each row has
    `id="{{ signal_id }}"` so `dashboard.html` anchor links resolve),
  - explicit evidence-class tag per signal (`hardware`, `roadmap`,
    `policy`, etc.) matching CLAUDE.md §3,
  - URL-bearing signals link to the underlying article;
    URL-less signals render plain titles,
  - empty-signal-list path renders an honesty notice
    rather than a blank page (CLAUDE.md §8).
- `qday_clock/render/templates.py`:
  - new `render_dashboard(state, template_dir=None)` and
    `render_sources(state, signals, template_dir=None)` following the
    existing `render_index` / `render_methodology` / `render_about`
    contract (Jinja2 `StrictUndefined`, file loader rooted at `site/`),
  - per-axis labels centralized in module-level `_AXIS_LABELS` so the
    templates stay declarative,
  - `render_sources` sorts by `(axis, -normalized_value, signal_id)`
    for deterministic output — important for forever-deterministic
    rendering and for diffing future readings.
- `tests/render/test_jinja_smoke.py`:
  - `test_render_dashboard_smoke` — asserts all 5 axes render, PQC
    axis is flagged as inverse, Mosca panel present,
    `sources.html#…` drill-down anchors emitted.
  - `test_render_sources_smoke` — asserts each signal renders with
    its ID anchor, evidence-class tag is visible, URL-bearing signals
    get a link.
  - `test_render_sources_handles_empty_signal_list` — guards the
    honesty-notice path so a future regression doesn't silently
    render a blank sources page.
- `tests/test_forbidden_language.py` extended to lint
  `site/dashboard.tmpl.html` and `site/sources.tmpl.html` against the
  prediction / marketing-language pattern set.

### Verification — Path C (v0.2 UI layer)
- `python3 -m pytest tests/` — **218 passed** (was 213; +3 render
  smokes + 2 forbidden-language lint cases).
- v0.1 and v0.2 golden replays still hash-locked
  (`aa5a8c11…` and `9d20017e…` unchanged).
- Forbidden-language lint passes on both new templates without any
  allow-list additions (the templates use "this is a reading, not a
  prediction" phrasing, which is already in `ALLOW_CONTEXTS`).

### Path C — what's still deferred (still v0.2)
- Curator-side workflow that publishes the signed manifest as a
  release artifact (still v0.2 — Path B section above).
- Daily cron in `refresh.yml`.
- A pipeline wire-up that emits `dashboard.html` + `sources.html` from
  the same `compute_clock_state` run that produces
  `data/clock_state.json` (the templates and renderers are live; only
  the build-step entry point is unwritten).

### Added — Path D: build-step entry point (`qday_clock.build`)
- New module `qday_clock/build.py` wires the full pipeline
  (ingest → score → sign → render) behind one function and one CLI:
  - `BuildConfig` — dataclass: `site_dir`, `seed_signals_path`,
    `methodology_path`, `signing_key_file`, `signing_key_b64_env`
    (default `QDAY_SIGNING_KEY_B64`), `allow_ephemeral_key`, `now`,
    `extra_signals`.
  - `BuildReport` — dataclass: `state`, `canonical_sha256`,
    `manifest_path`, `history_path`, `rendered_pages`,
    `used_ephemeral_key`.
  - `build_site(config)` — runs the full pipeline and emits all five
    pages (`index.html`, `methodology.html`, `about.html`,
    `dashboard.html`, `sources.html`) plus `data/clock_state.json`
    (signed) and an appended line in `data/history.jsonl`.
  - `main(argv)` — argparse CLI returning `0` on success and `1` on
    a missing-signing-key fail-closed event. CLI flags mirror the
    config fields; `--allow-ephemeral-key` is the documented escape
    hatch for local dev / smoke runs.
- **Fail-closed signing-key resolution order**, in priority:
  1. `--signing-key-file` (accepts either raw 32 bytes OR base64-text
     contents — `build.signing_key_file_bad_format` if neither).
  2. `QDAY_SIGNING_KEY_B64` env var (base64).
  3. Ephemeral key, **only** if `--allow-ephemeral-key` is set;
     `BuildReport.used_ephemeral_key=True` surfaces this so a CI run
     can refuse to publish ephemeral-signed artifacts.
  4. Otherwise: `SignatureError(error_code="build.no_signing_key")`.
- **Step-change gate path wired**: when a previous
  `site/data/clock_state.json` already exists, `build_site` parses
  its `axes` block into `previous_axes_readings` and passes it to
  `compute_clock_state` so the MultiSourceConfirmationGate +
  AntiStiffnessGate observers fire on day-over-day diffs. A
  malformed previous state raises
  `IngestError(error_code="build.previous_state_bad_json")` —
  per CLAUDE.md §8, a corrupted artifact is not silently demoted to
  a cold start (that would mask a real corruption event and disable
  step-change gates without telling anyone).
- **Render reads the signed payload back**, not the in-memory
  `ClockState`. The renderer is fed `ClockState.model_validate(
  signed_payload_without_sig_fields)` so the rendered footer can
  never drift from the signed body's canonical-sha attestation in
  about/dashboard pages.
- New error codes (all carry `error_code` per existing pattern):
  - `build.no_signing_key`
  - `build.signing_key_file_missing`
  - `build.signing_key_file_bad_format`
  - `build.signing_key_env_bad_base64`
  - `build.previous_state_bad_json`
  - `build.previous_state_bad_shape`
  - `build.methodology_missing`

### Tests — Path D (build entry point)
- New `tests/test_build.py` — **11 tests**, all green:
  - `test_build_emits_all_pages_and_signed_manifest` — all five
    pages land with >200 bytes; signature round-trips under embedded
    pubkey; one history line; `used_ephemeral_key=True` surfaced.
  - `test_dashboard_and_sources_reference_each_other` — regex pulls
    every `sources.html#<id>` anchor from the rendered dashboard and
    asserts a matching `id="<id>"` lives in the rendered sources
    page (drill-down link consistency).
  - `test_second_build_appends_history_and_reads_previous_state` —
    two consecutive builds produce **two** history lines, not one
    overwritten line; second build parses first build's
    `clock_state.json` without error.
  - `test_corrupt_previous_state_raises` — bad previous JSON →
    `IngestError("build.previous_state_bad_json")`.
  - `test_signing_key_missing_is_fail_closed` — no file, no env, no
    ephemeral → `SignatureError("build.no_signing_key")`.
  - `test_signing_key_from_env_b64` — env-var path; signed manifest
    `signing_pubkey` matches the supplied key.
  - `test_signing_key_from_file_raw_bytes` — file-path with raw 32
    bytes; signed manifest `signing_pubkey` matches.
  - `test_signing_key_file_bad_format_raises` →
    `SignatureError("build.signing_key_file_bad_format")`.
  - `test_missing_methodology_raises` →
    `IngestError("build.methodology_missing")`.
  - `test_cli_main_returns_zero_on_success` — CLI `main(argv)` with
    `--allow-ephemeral-key` returns 0 and prints canonical sha + each
    page name.
  - `test_cli_main_returns_one_on_missing_key` — CLI without
    ephemeral opt-in returns 1 and surfaces `build.no_signing_key`
    on stderr.

### Verification — Path D (build entry point)
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_build.py -x -q` — **11 passed**.
- `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q` — **229 passed** (was 218; +11
  build-entry-point tests).
- v0.1 and v0.2 golden replays still hash-locked (`aa5a8c11…` and
  `9d20017e…` unchanged — the new module is purely additive and the
  golden replays go through `replay.py`, not the new build path).
- Forbidden-language lint untouched.

### Added — Path E: deploy-workflow fix (`pages-deploy.yml`)
Pre-v0.2.3 the deploy workflow was, in practice, broken:
`Render static site` invoked `qday_clock.render.cli build` (which has
never existed) with `continue-on-error: true`, then the fallback step
ran `cp -R site _site` and uploaded the **raw Jinja templates** with
`{{ }}` placeholders. Any push to `main` would have shipped an
unrendered, unsigned site. This is a §8 silent-fallthrough hazard
caught only because we sat down to actually deploy.

Rewrite scope:
- **Fail loud on missing signing-key secret** (new step
  `Assert signing-key secret is present`). If
  `secrets.QDAY_SIGNING_KEY_B64` is empty, the workflow exits 1 with a
  human-readable error rather than silently degrading to an ephemeral
  key (which would publish a different pubkey on every deploy and
  break the "embed pubkey in about.html for re-verification" story).
- **Real renderer invocation**: `python -m qday_clock.build
  --site-dir _site --seed-signals data/seed_signals.json
  --methodology METHODOLOGY.md` (the v0.2.2 entry point). The
  signing key is passed through the environment via
  `QDAY_SIGNING_KEY_B64`.
- **Asset + CNAME staging**: explicit step copies `site/assets/`
  and `site/CNAME` into `_site/`. The renderer deliberately doesn't
  touch the asset tree (its job is HTML + signed manifest); the
  workflow owns asset placement.
- **Post-build verification step**: asserts that all 5 rendered
  HTML files exist and are non-empty, and that
  `_site/data/clock_state.json` exists, before the artifact is handed
  to `actions/upload-pages-artifact`. Defence-in-depth against any
  earlier step silently no-op'ing.
- **Removed the `cp -R site _site` fallback** entirely. If the
  build fails, the deploy fails. No silent success path.

### Tests — Path E
- New `tests/test_build.py::test_rendered_pages_reference_assets_css`
  asserts every rendered page references `assets/clock.css`. This
  guards the deploy contract: the workflow stages `site/assets/`
  alongside the rendered HTML; if a future template change drops the
  stylesheet link, the workflow would still ship the asset tree but
  the pages would render unstyled and nothing else would catch it.

### Verification — Path E
- Local smoke of the exact CLI the workflow invokes:
  ```
  python3 -m qday_clock.build \
    --site-dir /tmp/qday_test_site \
    --seed-signals data/seed_signals.json \
    --methodology METHODOLOGY.md \
    --allow-ephemeral-key
  ```
  emits all 5 pages plus `data/{clock_state.json,history.jsonl}`;
  followed by `cp -R site/assets _site/assets` + `cp site/CNAME
  _site/CNAME`, the final tree contains every artifact GH Pages needs.
  Canonical sha256 of the smoke run:
  `7522f0bdc85e083ae517355a06c67e84b152d0a597405305c11f83398cc813c4`
  (ephemeral-key — not a deploy attestation, just a smoke
  reproducibility anchor).
- `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q` — **230 passed** (was 229; +1
  asset-ref guard).
- v0.1 and v0.2 golden replays still hash-locked.

### Path E — what's required from Mark before the first real deploy
- **Repo secret `QDAY_SIGNING_KEY_B64`**: base64 of the 32 raw bytes
  in `~/.config/qday_clock/signing_ed25519.key`. Generate locally
  with `base64 -i ~/.config/qday_clock/signing_ed25519.key | tr -d
  '\n'` and paste into the GH repo secret. Without this, the
  workflow refuses to deploy.
- **DNS for `icqubit.com`**: an A/AAAA or CNAME record pointing at
  GitHub Pages (`<user>.github.io.`). The `site/CNAME` file is
  staged by the workflow; DNS is the Mark-side half.
- **Pages source = GitHub Actions** in repo Settings → Pages
  (not "Deploy from a branch").

### Path E — what's still deferred (still v0.2)
- Curator-side workflow that publishes the signed manifest as a
  release artifact (Path B section above).
- Daily cron in `refresh.yml` (currently `workflow_dispatch`-only).

### Added — Path F: v0.2.4 — methodology URL rename + authorship cleanup
Caught during the first live deploy of `https://icqubit.com/`: the
signed `clock_state.json` `methodology_url` field pointed at
`https://github.com/MarkEatherly/subvurs/blob/main/public_interest/qday_clock/METHODOLOGY.md`,
a repo path that does not exist (the SBVRS repo is under MarsVMondo,
the standalone repo is `subvurs/qday-clock`). The link rendered into
the dashboard footer was therefore dead. v0.2.4 swaps the URL to the
live `https://icqubit.com/methodology.html` (which the v0.2.2 build
step already renders) and removes the `Mark Eatherly` authorship
string from `pyproject.toml` and `LICENSE` in favor of `Subvurs`
project-level authorship — per Mark's request to keep the public-facing
artifacts cleanly under the Subvurs identity.

Files changed:
- `qday_clock/score/clock.py`: `METHODOLOGY_URL` set to
  `https://icqubit.com/methodology.html`.
- `pyproject.toml`: `authors = [{ name = "Subvurs" }]` (was
  `Mark Eatherly`). Version bumped `0.1.0` → `0.2.4` to match git
  tag cadence (the v0.2.0/.1/.2/.3 tags were git-only; v0.2.4 is the
  first release where the pyproject string is brought in line).
- `qday_clock/__init__.py`: `__version__ = "0.2.4"` (was `0.1.0`).
- `LICENSE`: `Copyright (c) 2026 Subvurs` (was `Mark Eatherly`).

### Tests — Path F (golden replay re-lock)
The `methodology_url` rename changes the byte image of every signed
`clock_state.json`, so both golden replay hashes had to be re-locked.
Per CLAUDE.md §7 this is the documented re-lock path — the test files
explicitly support `EXPECTED_CANONICAL_HASH = None` bootstrap mode for
exactly this case, and re-locking is conditional on a CHANGELOG entry
documenting the change (this entry).

- `tests/golden/test_golden_replay.py::EXPECTED_CANONICAL_HASH`
  re-locked: `aa5a8c11…` → `696887e1a72fbaada43940c0968a7b6a041f99b35b84d4b452bed7eb955a9caa`.
- `tests/golden/test_golden_replay_v02.py::EXPECTED_CANONICAL_HASH`
  re-locked: `9d20017e…` → `96eb797b8a006bf93eae7026b4d49837867c329cd0d767f30e058f6a01ce14b1`.
- `tests/golden/expected_state.json` regenerated as a deterministic
  byte-identical canonical (RFC-8785) replay snapshot of
  `manifest_2026_q1.json`. This file isn't read by any test (a
  stale snapshot artifact); regenerated only so a future reader
  doesn't mistake it for current data.
- v0.2 gate-fire contract unchanged: both `RoadmapWeightCapGate`
  and `StaleSignalGate` still fire on `manifest_2026_v02.json` per
  the Goodhart-contract assertion in
  `test_golden_replay_v02_required_gates_fire`.

### Verification — Path F
- `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q` — 230 passed (unchanged from Path E).
- `methodology_url` in the regenerated `expected_state.json` reads
  `https://icqubit.com/methodology.html` (verified via
  `python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('tests/golden/expected_state.json'))['methodology_url'])"`).
- Forbidden-language lint untouched.
- Live verification deferred to the post-deploy step (re-deploy
  must regenerate the live `clock_state.json` with the new URL,
  then `curl -s https://icqubit.com/data/clock_state.json | jq .methodology_url`
  must read `https://icqubit.com/methodology.html`).

### Added — Path G: v0.2.5 — ruff lint cleanup
The v0.2.4 deploy fixed the standalone-repo CI workflow (the
`working-directory` mis-pointer left over from the SBVRS-source-tree
layout). Once the CI step actually ran, it surfaced **119 pre-existing
ruff lint errors** that had been invisible behind the broken bash step.
v0.2.5 cleans them up to zero.

Auto-fixed (142 in total across `--fix` cascade):
- `UP017` × 33: `datetime.timezone.utc` → `datetime.UTC`
- `UP045` × 33: `Optional[X]` → `X | None` (PEP 604)
- `I001` × 17: import ordering
- `UP037` × 7: quoted runtime annotations stripped
- `F401` × 5: unused imports removed
- `UP035` × 3: `typing` deprecated imports → `collections.abc`
- `UP012` × 1: `"x".encode("utf-8")` → `"x".encode()`

Manual fixes:
- `B904`: `qday_clock/build.py:351` — added `from exc` on the SystemExit
  re-raise so the original ValueError chain is preserved.
- `UP042` × 2: `qday_clock/core/schemas.py` — `class EvidenceClass(str, Enum)`
  and `class AxisId(str, Enum)` migrated to `StrEnum`. **Verified
  canonical-safe**: both golden replay hashes
  (`696887e1…` v0.1, `96eb797b…` v0.2) still match byte-for-byte after
  the change, confirming Pydantic JSON-mode serialization uses `.value`
  identically for both base patterns.
- `B905` × 2: `axis_physical_scaling.py:142`, `axis_resource_estimate.py:251`
  — added `strict=False` to `zip(anchors, anchors[1:])` (intentional
  pair-wise sliding window, length difference is expected).
- `B017` × 2: `tests/core/test_schemas.py:57, 80` — `pytest.raises(Exception)`
  → `pytest.raises(ValidationError)` (the actual exception Pydantic
  raises on the [0,1] clip and frozen-mutation paths).
- `E501` × 8 manual: line wraps in `schemas.py`, `classifier.py`,
  `score/clock.py` (intermediate-variable extraction in the
  confidence-band calculation), `tests/test_smoke.py` (extracted
  `lowered = html_method.lower()`).
- `E501` × 5 via per-file ignore: `qday_clock/render/svg_clock.py` —
  added `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]` entry. The long lines are
  literal SVG markup inside an f-string; splitting them would inject
  whitespace into the rendered SVG output.

Files changed:
- `pyproject.toml`: per-file-ignores block added; version `0.2.4 → 0.2.5`.
- `qday_clock/__init__.py`: `__version__ = "0.2.5"`.
- 27 source/test files touched by `ruff --fix` and manual edits.

### Verification — Path G
- `python3 -m ruff check qday_clock tests` — `All checks passed!`
- `python3 -m pytest tests/` — 230 passed (no test deletions or
  threshold relaxations per CLAUDE.md §7).
- `python3 -m pytest tests/golden/` — both canonical hashes still
  byte-identical after the StrEnum migration (the canonical-safety
  question I flagged in the §7 honest-flag).
- `clock_state.json` artifact is byte-identical to v0.2.4 (no
  re-lock needed).

This is a pure CI/code-quality cleanup with no public-facing artifact
change. Nothing in the signed `clock_state.json` moves.

## [0.1.0] — MVP scaffold

### Added
- Repository structure under `public_interest/qday_clock/`
- `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `METHODOLOGY.md`, `THREAT_MODEL.md`
- Core package: `schemas`, `canonical` (RFC 8785), `signing` (Ed25519),
  `errors`, `time`
- Ingest: `seed_signals.py` (MVP — manual seed; Curator integration
  stubbed but not wired)
- Extract: `axis_logical_qubits.py` (1 of 5 axes live)
- Score: `weights`, `axes`, `clock`, `gri_baseline`, `mosca` (calculator
  only), `gates` with **StaticPointGate**, **SingleSourceCapGate**,
  **ThresholdGuard**
- Render: `svg_clock`, `manifest`, templates for `index.html`,
  `methodology.html`, `about.html`
- Tests: core unit, 1 golden fixture, 3 adversarial fixtures
  (one per active gate), forbidden-language lint
- CI: `ci.yml`, `pages-deploy.yml`
- Docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `GATE_CATALOG.md`, `SIGNAL_CATALOG.md`
- `qday_clock.verify.replay` CLI with `--check <signed.json>` and
  `--replay <fixture.json>` modes (used by `ci.yml`)

### Verification — v0.1.0 lock
- Test suite: **65 passed** (`pytest tests/ -v`). The golden-bootstrap
  branch in `tests/golden/test_golden_replay.py` (active only when
  `EXPECTED_CANONICAL_HASH is None`) is dormant; re-lock requires
  explicitly clearing the constant per CLAUDE.md §7.
- Golden canonical hash locked at
  `aa5a8c11dd0981ce19a191aa74eadeb7ec51211f7efe7793aff0b5bbee242fe9`
  (RFC 8785 canonical form of the unsigned `ClockState` body produced
  by `tests/golden/manifest_2026_q1.json`, with `generated_at` pinned
  to `2026-04-01T00:00:00+00:00`). Drift in this hash means either
  (a) a scoring change that needs a CHANGELOG entry, or (b) a
  canonicalization / schema regression.
- `python -m qday_clock.verify.replay --replay tests/golden/manifest_2026_q1.json`
  reproduces the locked hash byte-for-byte.

### Deferred to v0.2
- Curator manifest export integration
- Remaining 4 axes (physical scaling, resource estimate, error rate,
  PQC migration)
- `dashboard.html` + `sources.html`
- Remaining 5 gates: `MultiSourceConfirmationGate`,
  `RoadmapWeightCapGate`, `StaleSignalGate`, `AntiStiffnessGate`,
  `ContrastSaturationGate`
- Daily refresh workflow with human-reviewed auto-PR
  (`.github/workflows/refresh.yml`)

### Deferred to v0.3
- Interactive Mosca calculator on dashboard
- History visualization
- RSS / email digest of clock changes
- Public API endpoint serving `clock_state.json` with CORS
